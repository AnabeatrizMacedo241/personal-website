It is hard seeing a player with a single role like a shooter, rebounder, or playmaker skills nowadays. In my newest article for the Center for Sports Analytics at Samford University I try to understand patterns to uncover new types of roles for the players through Machine Learning models in today's NBA era. If you are also wondering how old-school players would fit in today's NBA and check their career evolution, you can check out the dashboard on your desktop.")
